# Fibonacci-math-function-in-python

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. The sequence goes like this: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...
In other words, it's a sequence of numbers in which each number is equal to the sum of the previous two numbers in the sequence. The sequence can start with different numbers, but the most common starting numbers are 0 and 1.

For example :

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...

The Fibonacci sequence can be used in many fields such as in mathematics, physics, biology and computer science.
